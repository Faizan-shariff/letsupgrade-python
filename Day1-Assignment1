What is Python? What are the ways to install python in your PC?
Python: 
      Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, 
high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with 
dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive 
for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a 
scripting or glue language to connect existing components 
together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes 
readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.

              A code environment is a software that provides 
comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

build automation tools and a debugger. Some environments, such as NetBeans
and Eclipse, contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; 
others, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus, do not.

Generate code, which can actually compile,run,and executed on that 
Platform.
